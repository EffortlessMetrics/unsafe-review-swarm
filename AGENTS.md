# Agent operating contract

Use the repo source-of-truth stack:

1. Read `.unsafe-review-spec/goals/active.toml`.
2. Read the linked plan item.
3. Read the linked spec.
4. Read the linked proposal only for context.
5. Make one PR-sized change.
6. Update support tiers or policy ledgers only if the claim/policy changes.
7. Run the proof commands listed in the plan item.
8. Do not invent missing claims. If proof is missing, keep the claim advisory/experimental.
9. Do not use `.jules`, `.codex`, or product runtime output directories as unsafe-review source-of-truth state.
10. Do not stop at “human merge required” unless the repo has that policy in a current source-of-truth file.

If a specific command, lint, API, feature flag, crate name, or workflow name is mentioned, verify it exists before building a PR around it.
